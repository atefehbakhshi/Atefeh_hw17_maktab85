Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate
files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain
both. React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when
working with UI inside the JavaScript code.

-Embedding Expressions in JSX

-Specifying Attributes with JSX

-JSX Prevents Injection Attacks : By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX
 before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly
 written in your application.
