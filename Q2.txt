1- "Speed": React basically allows developers to utilize individual parts of their application
   In simple terms, different developers can write individual parts and all changes made
   won’t cause the logic of the application.
        
2- "Flexibility": Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and
   is flexible due to its modular structure. This flexibility, in turn, saves a huge amount of time
   and cost to businesses.

3- "Performance": React JS was designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework
    offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes complex apps run extremely fast.

4- "Reusable Components": It saves time for developers as they don’t have to write various codes for the
    same features.
