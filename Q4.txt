- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and
 think about each piece in isolation. A Component is one of the core building
 blocks of React. Components make the task of building UIs much easier.

Difference: 
1- A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props
 as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend 
 from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.

2- React lifecycle methods (for example, componentDidMount) cannot be used in functional
 components. React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components.

3- Hooks can be easily used in functional components to make them Stateful. It requires
 different syntax inside a class component to implement hooks.

4- Constructors are not used in functional components. Constructor are used as it needs
 to store state in class components. 

5- Multiple states merge automatically in class components, but in functional
 components it must handle manually.
